            <p>
              As I believe in the power of transformation, I've decided to make a career change after 25 years as a DJ and a small business owner. I’m finally pursuing my love for computer science. Now as a graduate of the Galvanize Full Stack Web Developer
              Program. My goal is to start a career in technology, learn as much as possible, and grow as a company grows. My hope is to work with a company creating a positive impact on society in a entry level tech role where I can work collaboratively with
              others, and have fun along the way!

        <h4>Certificate of Completion</h4>
        <p>
          Certificate of Completion in the Full Stack Web Development Immersive. Successfully completed 101 days, 7 hours a day, totaling 707 hours of coursework that created applications that resulted in a library of projects with real-world applications by
          covering the languages, frameworks, and computer science fundamentals essential to a career in web development. This began with a extensive foundation in JavaScript (ES5) as well as programming fundamentals, version control, terminal and basic
          algorithms working with industry standard software like Atom, Github, and so much more. Built multiple web pages with HTML5 and style them with CSS3, made web pages interactive with DOM manipulation and AJAX for client-side apps. Next built and
          deployed several dynamic server-side web apps using Node.js and Express as well as how to manage databases using SQL and PostgreSQL finally completing a server-side application using an agile workflow, project management tools and version control
          with a team of classmates. Next, we combined what you learned in the front-end and server-side modules and built on that foundation by learning client-side frameworks such as AngularJS, React and Vue. Culminating in building a complete single-page
          application (both client-side and server-side) in a group setting, following an agile workflow. Then, we tackled more complex algorithms such as sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, tree and graph traversal, recursion, memory loss, and how to
          calculate the Big O notation of functions and demonstrated these skills live on a whiteboard - an essential skill for most technical interviews. completing an independent capstone project that can demonstrate the full range of your skills to
          employers. This is all culminated in Capstone project where we combined all the topics and exercises learned in class plus unfamiliar enviornments that are additional technologies, libraries, frameworks and languages that we weren't taught, but
          rather learned on our own individually to demonstrate versatility and fitness for a position in an ever-changing tech landscape.
