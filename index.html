            <p>
              As I believe in the power of transformation, I've decided to make a career change after 25 years as a DJ and a small business owner. I’m finally pursuing my love for computer science. Now as a graduate of the Galvanize Full Stack Web Developer
              Program. My goal is to start a career in technology, learn as much as possible, and grow as a company grows. My hope is to work with a company creating a positive impact on society in a entry level tech role where I can work collaboratively with
              others, and have fun along the way!

        <h4>Certificate of Completion</h4>
        <p>
          Certificate of Completion in the Full Stack Web Development Immersive. Successfully completed 101 days, 7 hours a day, totaling 707 hours of coursework that created applications that resulted in a library of projects with real-world applications by
          covering the languages, frameworks, and computer science fundamentals essential to a career in web development. This began with a extensive foundation in JavaScript (ES5) as well as programming fundamentals, version control, terminal and basic
          algorithms working with industry standard software like Atom, Github, and so much more. Built multiple web pages with HTML5 and style them with CSS3, made web pages interactive with DOM manipulation and AJAX for client-side apps. Next built and
          deployed several dynamic server-side web apps using Node.js and Express as well as how to manage databases using SQL and PostgreSQL finally completing a server-side application using an agile workflow, project management tools and version control
          with a team of classmates. Next, we combined what you learned in the front-end and server-side modules and built on that foundation by learning client-side frameworks such as AngularJS, React and Vue. Culminating in building a complete single-page
          application (both client-side and server-side) in a group setting, following an agile workflow. Then, we tackled more complex algorithms such as sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, tree and graph traversal, recursion, memory loss, and how to
          calculate the Big O notation of functions and demonstrated these skills live on a whiteboard - an essential skill for most technical interviews. completing an independent capstone project that can demonstrate the full range of your skills to
          employers. This is all culminated in Capstone project where we combined all the topics and exercises learned in class plus unfamiliar enviornments that are additional technologies, libraries, frameworks and languages that we weren't taught, but
          rather learned on our own individually to demonstrate versatility and fitness for a position in an ever-changing tech landscape.

              <p>
                The 'Let's Eat!' app enables household members to plan meals according to what each person would like to eat for dinner on a given night. For example, a child may enter his or her desired food in the suggestion form. A parent may then accept or
                reject the suggested meal. There was also a superuser added with admin access privileges to delete users. O.auth using Facebook and Google+ plus bCrypt were implemented for user registration and login. Passwords were salted and hashed. API calls
                using Google maps and a meal planning API. Various NodeJs modules and dependencies were used in the process. Lists and meal recommendation were implemented using EJS/Express, Knex migrations and seeding, and database architecture and queries using
                PostgreSQL. Team 'Let’s Eat!' used Pivotal Tracker to write and organize our stories and epics. We used Balsamiq to create wire-frames. We used the AGILE workflow and SCRUM techniques twice daily to update our progress and identify and issues or
                needs that had to be addressed in order to stay on task and meet our deadline. This also required a lot of communication and delegation of workflow/tasks for each individual in the team. This was assigned as a collaborative group project. There were
                times where we worked as a group in order to complete more challenging objectives on both ends together. We also used paired programming. Start to finish in 5 days!

              <h3>Project Name Here</h3>
              <p>
                Fantasy Football users rejoice! Welcome to the hottest new way to do FFL. This project will be a fantasy football (NFL) single page app (SPA). Fantasy football is centered around creating a “fantasy” team out of real life NFL players, and pitting
                your fantasy team against other teams. Groups of users, usually 6-8, will create their own teams as part of a “league”, and will compete against other individuals within that league.</p>
              <p>Individuals in a fantasy football league will choose real players in the American National Football League (NFL) for their teams, and these teams will face each other weekly in a one-on-one (aka head-to-head) matchup during actual NFL games.
                Players in the real games perform actions that score points in fantasy football, and whichever fantasy team scores more points in that matchup wins. Teams with the best win/loss records enter fantasy playoffs, and an eventual champion is selected.</p>
              <h3>Makeup of a fantasy team</h3>
              <p>The main (splash) page will consist of live NFL fantasy football league news and information using an API call. This information will be scrolling across the page like a carousel or a ticker. The app will have a navigation bar. In the nav bar, it
                will allow users to sign up and/or login to the site and allow users to navigate the page. It may use breadcrumbs as well to track user progress through the SPA. There will be a footer at the bottom of the SPA with copyright information. There will
                be a current roster of all 32 NFL teams and a list of the highest ranking fantasy players according to last years stats. Initially a user may make his own league and become a commissioner. The league consists of a max of 8 teams (Minimum of six). The
                league has a name chosen by the commissioner and the commissioner and only the commissioner can give points to each team's starting roster. The commissioner can own a team and is the only user that can add or delete a team.</p>
              <h5>There are 32 NFL teams, and your fantasy team will consist of players from some of these teams.</h5>
              <p>There are lots of different positions on a NFL team, but for fantasy football purposes, we simplify the different positions greatly: all you have to worry about is Quarterback (QB), Running back (RB), Wide Receiver (WR), Tight End (TE), Kicker
                (K), and Defense/Special Teams (D/ST). Defense/Special Teams is a special position on your roster, it represents the entire Defense and Special Teams units, which are made up of many players, for one of the 32 teams. All other players you select will
                be individual players.</p>
              <p>How players score points isn’t important right now, you can worry about that later. For those of you familiar with fantasy football, this application will operate under standard scoring rules.</p>
              <p>Fantasy teams will have 16 members, but only 9 of them will actually count towards scoring in the weekly matchup against another fantasy team. The other 7 will remain on the team’s “bench”, and any points they score will not count towards your
                team’s total that week. Your team, and every team in the league, will select players in a “fantasy draft” – more about that later.</p>
              <p>Our fantasy team’s 9-player active roster will have 1 Quarterback (QB), 2 Running backs (RB), 2 Wide Receivers (WR), 1 Tight End (TE), 1 Flex (which can either be a RB, WR, or TE), 1 Kicker (K), and 1 Defense/Special Teams (D/ST).</p>
              <p>An example 16-man roster might look like the following:</p>
              <h4>Example Active Roster</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>QB: Aaron Rodgers (GB)</li>
                <li>RB: Le'Veon Bell (PIT)</li>
                <li>RB: Ezekiel Elliott (DAL)</li>
                <li>WR: Antonio Brown (PIT)</li>
                <li>WR: Julio Jones (ATL)</li>
                <li>TE: Rob Gronkowski (NE)</li>
                <li>FLEX: David Johnson (AZ)</li>
                <li>K: Stephen Gostkowski (NE)</li>
                <li>D/ST: Seattle Seahawks</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Bench Example:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>TE: Travis Kelce (KC)</li>
                <li>RB: LeSean McCoy (BUF)</li>
                <li>WR: Odell Beckham Jr. (NYG)</li>
                <li>QB: Matt Ryan (ATL)</li>
                <li>RB: Jay Ajayi (MIA)</li>
                <li>K: Justin Tucker (BAL)</li>
                <li>D/ST: Kansas City Chiefs (KC)</li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Recap</h3>
              <p>Possible technologies to be used in this app is AngularJS (1.6.x and above), Javascript (ECMAscript 16), jQuery, API calls, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, Ionic, CSS3, HTML5, Bootstrap, Materialize, Cordova, MongoDB. This will be a full CRUD
                application where users will be able to add, delete, update and post their weekly starting roster and comment on matchups. There will be client-side ui-router and services used in Angular.</p>
              <p>Stretch goals: To have O.Auth (Facebook/Google), Making both a native desktop and mobile app.
